# SPIDER
Robot designed to aid in disaster relief.
Automatically paths around searching for survivors and uses face recognition to relay information back to a command center.
Can also enter manual mode remotely for an operator to take control.
The SPIDER allows rescuers to stay out of dangerous areas after a disaster while still searching for survivors.
